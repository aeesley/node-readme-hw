# Unit 09: Node.js and ES6+

## Overview

We now arrive at another important milestone in our journey. The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client side, though it used third-party server-side APIs. In this and later units, you will learn how to write your own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately to build your own APIs.

In a previous era, this would be the point in our full-stack journey where we would begin learning a second programming language, such as PHP, to write server-side code. Luckily for us, Node.js—which was released in 2009—makes this unnecessary. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome, and allows us to write server-side code using JavaScript. We no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. We can (and will) do so from the command line.

In this unit, you will learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install third-party dependencies, and create interactive command-line applications. Node.js ships with what is referred to as a standard library. The standard library contains a number of modules that allow us to extend the functionality of Node.js, such as `fs`, which we will use to read and write files. There is also a large and robust ecosystem of third-party modules that you will learn how to add to applications to extend their functionality.

## Key Topics

* Node.js

    * process.argv

    * fs

* Modularization

    * require

    * module.exports

* npm

    * package.json

    * npm init

    * node_modules

* Inquirer

* ES6

    * let and const

    * Arrow functions

    * Template literals

    * Array methods (map, filter, reduce)

    * Spread and rest

    * Destructuring arrays and objects

* Asynchronous JavaScript

    * Callbacks

    * Promises

    * Async/await

    * Fetch API

    * Axios
 

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is npm?

2. What are three of the major changes introduced to JavaScript in ES6?

3. What are three approaches to handling asynchronous JavaScript?


## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if are able to: 

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchrony with callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

* Make server-side API calls with the Fetch API and Axios.


## Homework

Create a command-line application that uses input from a user to dynamically generates a good README for a GitHub project.


## Heads Up

* Starting this unit, you will begin to use Node.js. Be sure to have it installed on your computer **before** attending your classes. You can follow the installation instructions for [Mac](./04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) and [Windows](./04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md) computers.
